# Design: End-User README (Store-First)

## Overview
Create an end-user focused README for the Tomato Clock browser extension. The README should prioritize store installation for Chrome/Edge/Brave and Firefox (with placeholder links), then provide a concise usage guide, features, settings, FAQ, and a brief privacy note. It should avoid developer-only build instructions.

## Structure
1. **Title + One-line Description**
   - “Tomato Clock” + short tagline describing a cyberpunk-styled Pomodoro timer.

2. **Install (Store-first)**
   - Chrome Web Store placeholder link.
   - Firefox Add-ons (AMO) placeholder link.
   - Optional note to check back for official release if links are placeholders.

3. **Quick Start**
   - Open extension from toolbar.
   - Set work/break minutes.
   - Start/pause/stop timer.
   - Optional sound/notifications toggles.

4. **Features**
   - Pomodoro cycles.
   - Custom durations.
   - Sound preview.
   - Notifications.
   - Cyberpunk UI.

5. **Settings**
   - Explain the Work/Break inputs.
   - Explain “Save settings”.
   - Explain toggles for sound and notifications.

6. **FAQ**
   - Common user questions (timer behavior, changing durations, toggles).

7. **Privacy**
   - States settings saved locally and no data sent externally (align with current behavior).

## Tone and Style
- Friendly, concise, user-first.
- Avoid developer jargon.
- No build/compile instructions.

## Testing/Verification
- Manual review for clarity and accuracy against current UI behavior.
